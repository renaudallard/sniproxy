sniproxy 0.9.2 (2025-11-10)
==============================

* Reliability: resolver restarts keep pending DNS queries and
  automatically retry after the child process respawns.
* Reliability: binder helper respawns on IPC failures and uses
  length-prefixed framing to handle partial reads safely.
* Networking: outbound connects retry transient EADDRNOTAVAIL
  errors to smooth bursts of transparent proxy traffic.
