sniproxy 0.9.7 (2025-11-19)
==============================

* DNS: resolver blocks now default to `dnssec_validation relaxed`, enabling AD
  bit enforcement whenever upstream supports DNSSEC without requiring manual
  configuration tweaks.
* Security: sniproxy and sniproxy-cfg refuse to load configuration files that
  are group/world accessible by validating permissions on the opened descriptor,
  ensuring both initial startup and reloads uphold the guardrail.
* Documentation: README, architecture notes, and man pages were refreshed to
  describe the DNSSEC default, resolver requirements, and stricter configuration
  permission enforcement.

sniproxy 0.9.6 (2025-11-18)
==============================

* Security: Harden per-IP rate limiting and parser guardrails with FNV-1a hashes,
  collision cutoffs, HTTP header caps, TLS extension limits, and IPC payload clamps
  to block CPU or memory exhaustion attempts.
* DNS: arc4random()-seeded query IDs, leak-resistant handle tracking, and
  mutex-protected restarts prevent counter drift, leaks, or use-after-free in
  resolver lifecycle transitions.
* Reliability: shrink candidate queues now cap at 4096 entries with active
  trimming, buffer growth failures close connections explicitly, and log
  duration math clamps wraparound to 0.0.
* Hardening: secure memory wiping, PID file sanity checks, and buffer pool magic
  numbers detect corruption and ensure sensitive state never lingers in RAM.

sniproxy 0.9.5 (2025-11-15)
==============================

* Performance: cached ev_now() readings and idle hysteresis reduce needless wakeups and buffer thrash.
* Reliability: resolver crash logging avoids noisy write/writev warnings on Linux builds.
* CI: fuzz workflow auto-selects a libFuzzer-capable clang and surfaces compiler diagnostics.

sniproxy 0.9.4 (2025-11-14)
==============================

* Resource: connection_buffer_limit/client_buffer_limit/server_buffer_limit cap per-connection buffering.
* Security: configs with group/world permissions now abort startup instead of warning.
* IPC: helper children close all inherited descriptors other than their IPC socket.

sniproxy 0.9.3 (2025-11-12)
==============================

* Security: privilege dropping now verifies real/effective UID and aborts if root.
* Security: sniproxy and sniproxy-cfg warn when config files are readable or executable by group/others.
* IPC: binder/logger/resolver channels now encrypt control traffic and tighten validation/error reporting.
* Performance: idle connection buffers shrink proactively once a soft memory budget is exceeded.
* Resource: new connection_buffer_limit/client_buffer_limit/server_buffer_limit directives cap per-connection buffering.

sniproxy 0.9.2 (2025-11-10)
==============================

* Reliability: resolver restarts keep pending DNS queries and
  automatically retry after the child process respawns.
* Reliability: binder helper respawns on IPC failures and uses
  length-prefixed framing to handle partial reads safely.
* Networking: outbound connects retry transient EADDRNOTAVAIL
  errors to smooth bursts of transparent proxy traffic.
