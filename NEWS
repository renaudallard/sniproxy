sniproxy 0.9.3 (2025-11-12)
==============================

* Security: privilege dropping now verifies real/effective UID and aborts if root.
* Security: sniproxy and sniproxy-cfg warn when config files are readable or executable by group/others.
* IPC: binder/logger/resolver channels now encrypt control traffic and tighten validation/error reporting.
* Performance: idle connection buffers shrink proactively once a soft memory budget is exceeded.

sniproxy 0.9.2 (2025-11-10)
==============================

* Reliability: resolver restarts keep pending DNS queries and
  automatically retry after the child process respawns.
* Reliability: binder helper respawns on IPC failures and uses
  length-prefixed framing to handle partial reads safely.
* Networking: outbound connects retry transient EADDRNOTAVAIL
  errors to smooth bursts of transparent proxy traffic.
