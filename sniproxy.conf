    # NOTE: it is strongly recommended to use a local caching DNS server, since
    # uDNS and thus SNIProxy only uses single socket to each name server so
    # each DNS query is only protected by the 16 bit query ID and lacks
    # additional source port randomization. Additionally no caching is
    # preformed within SNIProxy, so a local resolver can improve performance.

    # Prefix with dot:// to send queries over DNS-over-TLS (default port 853).
    # When a hostname is used instead of an IP, the resolver will verify the
    # TLS certificate presented by the upstream nameserver. For IP targets,
    # append "/<tls-hostname>" to override the SNI/verification host if the
    # upstream presents a shared certificate (dot://9.9.9.9/dns.quad9.net).
