.SH NAME

SNIProxy \- transparent session based TLS and HTTP proxy

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsniproxy\fR [ -\fBc\fR \fIconfig\fR ] [ -\fBf\fR ]
[ -\fBn\fR \fIfile-descriptor-limit\fR ] [ -\fBV\fR ] [ -\fBT\fR \fImin-tls-version\fR ] [ -\fBd\fR ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections, including HTTP/2 requests,
based on the hostname contained in the initial request of the TCP
session. This enables HTTPS name-based virtual hosting to separate
backend servers without installing the private key on the proxy
machine\&. By default TLS 1.2 (and newer) client hellos are
accepted\&.

For security reasons the configuration file must not be readable or
executable by group/other users. sniproxy verifies the permissions after
opening the file and aborts startup if it detects broader access.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-T \fImin-tls-version\fR
Set the minimum TLS ClientHello version that will be accepted. The
