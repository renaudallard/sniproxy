	* Release 0.9.3
	- Security: fail fast if dropping privileges leaves either real or effective UID at 0.
	- Security: warn sniproxy and sniproxy-cfg when configuration files are group or world accessible.
	- IPC: binder/logger/resolver channels encrypt control traffic and enforce stricter validation/error reporting.
	- Performance: idle connection buffers honor a soft memory limit and shrink immediately under load.
