	* Release 0.9.8
	- Security: require libpcre2 everywhere (runtime, tests, fuzzers, packaging)
	  and drop the legacy PCRE1 fallback; HKDF buffers now zeroize and reject
	  oversized labels.
	- Hardening: configuration reloads re-check file permissions, all config
	  paths must be absolute, resolver search domains are treated as literal
	  suffixes, and temporary connection dumps use mkostemp() with CLOEXEC.
	- Networking: resolver blocks now support DNS-over-TLS `dot://` upstreams
	  with full certificate validation using the system trust store.
	- Reliability: resolver cancellation gains an atomic memory fence to prevent
	  race windows, and documentation/metadata reflect the updated behavior.

	* Release 0.9.7
	- DNS: enable relaxed DNSSEC validation by default so wildcard tables and
	fallback targets benefit from authenticated data without manual resolver
	blocks.
	- Security: enforce fatal configuration-permission checks in both sniproxy
	and sniproxy-cfg using fstat() on the open descriptor, covering startup and
	reload flows.
	- Documentation: refresh README, architecture references, and man pages to
	reflect the new DNSSEC default and strict configuration requirements.

	* Release 0.9.6
	- Security: per-IP rate limiting now uses FNV-1a hashes with collision
	rejection and short-chain cutoffs, plus hard caps on HTTP headers, TLS
	extensions, and IPC payload lengths to stop CPU/memory exhaustion attacks.
	- DNS: arc4random()-seeded query IDs, mutex-protected restart flags, and query
	handle state assertions prevent leaks, counter drift, and use-after-free bugs.
	- Reliability: shrink candidate queues cap at 4096 entries with active
	trimming, buffer growth failures explicitly close connections, and log duration
	math clamps negative values caused by time jumps.
	- Hardening: buffer pool magic numbers detect corruption, secure_memzero wipes
	sensitive memory, and PID file validation prevents stale sockets or symlink
	abuse before daemon startup.

2025-11-15  Renaud Allard  <renaud@allard.it>

	* Release 0.9.5
	- Performance: cache ev_now and add hysteresis to idle timers and buffer growth.
	- Reliability: resolver crash handler avoids spurious write/writev warnings.
	- CI: fuzz workflow auto-selects clang/libFuzzer toolchains and surfaces compiler output.

2025-11-14  Renaud Allard  <renaud@allard.it>

	* Release 0.9.4
	- Resource: configurable per-connection buffer caps prevent slow clients from pinning unbounded RAM.
	- Security: configuration files with group/world permissions now abort startup instead of warning.
	- IPC: binder/logger/resolver children close all inherited FDs except their control socket.

2025-11-12  Renaud Allard  <renaud@allard.it>

	* Release 0.9.3
	- Security: fail fast if dropping privileges leaves either real or effective UID at 0.
	- Security: warn sniproxy and sniproxy-cfg when configuration files are group or world accessible.
	- IPC: binder/logger/resolver channels encrypt control traffic and enforce stricter validation/error reporting.
	- Performance: idle connection buffers honor a soft memory limit and shrink immediately under load.
	- Resource: configurable per-connection buffer caps prevent slow clients from pinning unbounded RAM.

2025-11-10  Renaud Allard  <renaud@allard.it>

	* Release 0.9.2
	- Harden resolver restarts and keep pending DNS queries alive
	- Restart binder helper on IPC failures and fix partial read handling
	- Retry outbound connects on transient EADDRNOTAVAIL errors
